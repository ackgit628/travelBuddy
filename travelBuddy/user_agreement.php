        <hr>

        <p>
            Unless travelBuddy explicitly acts as a reseller in certain scenarios, travelBuddy always acts as a facilitator by connecting the User with the respective service providers like airlines, hotels, restaurants, bus operators etc. (collectively referred to as "Service Providers"). travelBuddy's liability is limited to providing the User with a confirmed booking as selected by the User.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any issues or concerns faced by the User at the time of availing any such services shall be the sole responsibility of the Service Provider. travelBuddy will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence on part of any Service Provider.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless explicitly committed by travelBuddy as a part of any product or service:
            <ul>
                <li>travelBuddy assumes no liability for the standard of services as provided by the respective Service Providers.</li>
                <li>travelBuddy provides no guarantee with regard to their quality or fitness as represented.</li>
                <li>travelBuddy doesn't guarantee the availability of any services as listed by a Service Provider.</li>

        </p>
         
        <p>
            By making a booking, User understands travelBuddy merely provides a technology platform for booking of services and products and the ultimate liability rests on the respective Service Provider and not travelBuddy. Thus the ultimate contract of service is between User and Service Provider.

Any such additional fees, including fee towards any modifications thereof, will be displayed to the User before confirming the booking or collecting the payment from such User.
